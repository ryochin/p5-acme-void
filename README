NAME
    Acme::void - Making void things more void

SYNOPSIS
     use Acme::void;

     # showing explicitly it's under void context.
     void = do_something();

     # you can use it just as an alternative to built-in 'undef'.
     my $str = void;

     use Acme::void qw(:all);

     # you might like other languages.
     my $foo = nil;
     my $bar = null;

     # with broken love...
     if( $your_love eq nothing ){ 
        my @heart = empty;
     }

     # no operations here.
     noop;

     # or OOP!
     sub meet_a_cute_girl {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->noop;    # no way!
     }

DESCRIPTION
    You must need 'void' and other void-ish functions to write cool codes.

FUNCTIONS
    void
        Just provides the 'void way'.

    empty, nil, noop, nothing, null
        Synonyms to void. To import them, don't forget to use the module
        with ':all' switch.
